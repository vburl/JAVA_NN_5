/**
 * This class, Connection, is the class that forms the connection between neurons in the neural net. 
 * Connection stores a weight, 2 Neurons, a derivative (dEdW), and a Vector of partial derivatives (Part Deriv).
 * The weight is initialized to 1, and is the modifier to the information the Connection passes between Neurons.
 * The two Neurons specify the Neurons that the specific Connection object connects, 
 * and the direction (which one gets information from which while firing forwards or backwards).
 * The derivative (dEdW) is used to store the derivative of the error of the total system with respect to the weight of the specific Connection
 * The Vector PartDeriv stores the derivatives of the Error of a specific training set with respect to the weight of the specific Connection.
