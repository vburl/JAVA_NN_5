 * A main method, used for testing the functionality of the rest of my code.

 * Creates a NeuralNet with those specifications, and trains it to multiply its input by 2.
 * Training set input values start at 3 and increase by 7 each time, always having the corresponding doputput value be the input multiplied by 2.
 * Once trained, it then prints out all the the results of inputing the integers from 1 to 200.
